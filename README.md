This code is originaly adopted from Andrej Karpathy implementation of the GPT paper. The only difference is that this is implemeted in tensorflow not pytorch.I thought it would be some sort of a challenge
if i tried to use a different library, and indeed it was quite a challange but fairly simple. Such type of implementations where you translate from one library to another helps alot in buiding
a deeper understanding of the framework/library you are using. If you encounter any issues while training the model feel free to comment on the issue. The dataset used is a dataset that contains conversational dialogue that i got from Kaggle
